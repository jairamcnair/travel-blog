                    <div class="whatItIs-ad">
                        A boardwalk on Destin Harbor with a host of restaurants, shops, excursion booking kiosks, and other activities like a caricature artist, ziplining, and more. See the website for more details.

                    <div class="parking-ad"><span class="bold">Parking:</span> $20 for the day per car. Staying at the Emerald Grande Resort of The Village Inn would mean you could walk to the boardwalk and avoid paying this.</div>

                    <div class="tips-ad">
                        <div class="bold">Tips</div>
                        <div>The boardwalk is hot, if you have pets, get them pet shoes.</div>
                        <div>Most excursion boats (like to Crab Island, parasailing, etc.) are at HarborWalk Village so if you are going to Destin for excursions like Crab Island, I would stay at the Emerald Grande Resort ($$$$) or the Village Inn ($$) so you don't have to worry about parking each day (both hotels are within a 10 minute walk of HarborWalk Village).</div>

                            Destin Harbor Fireworks: Spring fireworks are on Thursdays from March to April 17th. Summer fireworks are on Mondays and Thursdays from May through August. Additional shows are on Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and July 4th.

        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <!--Distances from major activities-->
        <p>These are the best places to stay based on why you are visiting, and how far they are from popular excursions.</p>

                    <div class="costs-ad"><span class="bold">Est. Rate:</span> $500-$800/night (depending on your suite) plus tax and fees </div>

                    <div class="costs-ad"><span class="bold">Highlights:</span> 
                        This resort is located right in HarborWalk Village, meaning most Destin excursions will be right outside your door.
                        Most suites have kitchens, multiple full bathrooms, and a host of other amenities that make it more like you are staying in an apartment than a hotel room. Amenities can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emeraldgrande.com/emerald-grande/amenities">here</a> on the website.

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>These are some transportation options between different activities while you are at your destination.</p>
        <p>There are certain excursions I do not recommend driving yourself to because parking can be scarce. I am specifically talking about Norriego Point, which we couldn't go to our first time to Destin because parking was so scarce and we were leaving the next day! At the time I didn't think to take a taxi or Uber, which I recommend doing when going to Norriego Point. Here are some taxi options in the Destin area. </p>

                    <div class="costs-ad"><span class="bold">Est. Rate:</span> ~$4/mile (8 miles cost around $30 for our trip) </div>

                    <div class="costs-ad"><span class="bold">Notes:</span> 
                        I don't remember getting a confirmation email when I booked online, so I ended up calling them anyways. I would just book via call instead of using the website.

        <p>For now, here are some unique tips for this specific destination.</p>
        <p><b>Best time to go:</b> For clear water, avoid going to Destin after heavy storms. The best weather for water activities is late-May to mid-June, and mid-August to early-September. June and July can be too hot in my opinion, even for the water. </p>
