        <p>Here is some background knowledge about the destination, along with exciting activities, lodging options, transportation options, food recommendations, and tips for this specific destination.</p>
    
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <!--Destination is a…founded in…Major historical events?-->
        <p>
            Destin was founded by Captain Leonard Destin in the mid-19th century and officially became a city in 1984. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Destin is a vacation destination known for its white-sand beaches, clear green waters, and reputation as the "World's Luckiest Fishing Village".

        </p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The unique color of the water is due to sunlight reflecting off the fine, white sand made of Appalachian quartz. </p>




        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <!--Things to do, what it is, tips, the available times (subject to change), and estimated cost per person/total.-->
        <p>These are the most exciting things to do at this destination with some important information (what it is, times, dates, costs, links).</p>
        <p>In summary, the activities below discussed include HarborWalk Village, Crab Island, Norriego Point, Henderson Beach State Park, Visiting 30A, Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park, Gator Beach at Fudpucker's Beachside Bar and Grill, Okaloosa Island Pier, and other activities like parasailing, dolphin cruises, Baytowne Wharf, mini-golf, deep sea fishing, and pirate cruises.</p>
        <p>There are tons of other activities to do in Destin not mentioned, but can be found online. </p>

            <div class="mt-10">Most excursion boats (like to Crab Island, parasailing, etc.) are at HarborWalk Village so if you are going to Destin for excursions like Crab Island, I would stay at the Emerald Grande Resort ($$$$) or the Village Inn ($$) so you don't have to worry about parking each day (both hotels are within a 10 minute walk of HarborWalk Village).</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Destin Harbor Fireworks: Spring fireworks are on Thursdays from March to April 17th. Summer fireworks are on Mondays and Thursdays from May through August. Additional shows are on Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and July 4th.

        <div class="post-div mt-20"> <a href="https://www.emeraldgrande.com/harborwalk-village/harbor-cams" target="_blank">Here</a> is a live cam of Crab Island right now so you can see what the water clarity appears to be.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Crab Island can safely be considered Destin's top attraction. It is a sandbar with crystal clear water (in the right conditions) that would make you mistake it for a swimming pool or the Caribbean.
            To get to Crab Island, you must take a boat, which will most likely be docked in HarborWalk Village. We booked our Crab Island Tour with Happy's Watersports, who's contact information is below.
            They had floating platforms, though they are first-come-first-serve and they fill up quick. They also had paddle boards you could rent for an additional fee (I think $15 an hour, but I am not 100% sure).

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> Happy's Watersports operates out of a trailer in a parking lot, which you can park at for ~$10; or avoid parking by staying at the Emerald Grande Resort OR the Village Inn and walk right over.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Restrooms:</span> The boat had a small restroom on board. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Activity Times:</span> The 3-hour Crab Island Tour for us was 1 PM - 4 PM. I am not sure when the 4-hour Crab Island Tour was. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Cost:</span> ~$60 per person, plus taxes, fees, a tip, and any add-ons (like renting paddle boards, etc.). For two people, it was about $160 total (and we didn't rent paddle boards or anything). </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Tips</div>
            <div class="mt-10">The clarity of the water depends on the weather and tides. <a href="https://destintiki.com/crab-island-tides/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a website you can find tide information. </div>
            <div class="mt-10">The 3-hour tour was more than enough for us when we went. By the end of the 3rd hour we were ready to go and I was glad we didn't do the 4-hour one. There isn't much to do, and after the 'wow' factor wears off, you are just stuck chilling until it's time to leave, and the water was not as clear in the last hour as the tides change.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Make sure you bring a sun-hat/ball-cap, sunglasses, and sun-screen because the sun is tough out there, especially from 1 PM - 4 PM!
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                If you enjoy snorkeling (or have kids) make sure to bring goggles, a snorkel, and a small, *sturdy* (wooden-handled) fish net because there are lots of little fishes that swim in the sea vegetation that are fun to try and catch. The tour boat will have goggles, snorkels, and fish nets, but the fish nets are flimsy, and having your own goggles and snorkel is more ideal.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Bringing a mini-cooler with water is highly recommended, and potentially some refreshing snacks like fruit. Be sure to check what other items are allowed and which items aren't (i.e. glass, etc.)
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                You might see dolphins on the way to Crab Island and during other excursions, so I wouldn't book a Dolphin Cruise until maybe your last day if you haven't seen any dolphins.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Hours</div>
            <div>Crab Island is technically open, 24/7; but most excursion businesses close around 5 PM. Happy's Watersports is open 8:30 AM - 5 PM Sunday-Saturday.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Norriego Point is a popular snorkeling spot. We snorkeled around the rocks and saw tons of fish and even a sea turtle swimming along the rocks.

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> Street parking - The parking lot at Norriego Point Beach Access and Park is currently closed due to construction, so you currently there is only limited street parking, and you have to pay (I don't remember the cost, probably $20 for the day). Parking was very limited the times we went (2024 + 2025) and we didn't get a spot the first trip, which was a bummer because we were leaving the next day so we didn't get to go. I highly recommend taking a taxi or uber so you don't have to worry about parking. </div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Henderson Beach is a peaceful white-sand beach that is less crowded (at least when we went (8 AM - 10 AM early June 2024 + 2025)) and absolutely stunning.
            Walking to the shore line felt like I was approaching the gates of a tropical paradise.

        <div class="post-div black-bold mt-60">Visit 30A</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            30A is a a scenic county highway in Florida that runs along the Gulf Coast, connecting a series of small, picturesque beach towns like Seaside, Alys Beach, Rosemary Beach, and Grayton Beach. 30A is about an hour from Destin, but it is well worth the drive to see these extremley cute beach towns.
            <a href="https://30a.com/map/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a map of 30A.
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Every street in 30A is a photo-op. Everything looks so photo-ready. It looks like a movie scene, which is probably why it was one. The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey was shot in Seaside.
            30A is very bike-friendly. We rented bikes from 30A Bike Rentals for the day (we did the Park n' Ride Special). The rental place is directly beside the Timpoochee Trail, which runs right beside 30A and goes through all the beach towns.
            We hopped on the trail and biked all the way to Rosemary Beach (one of the last beach towns on 30A). 
            To give you an idea of where the rental is in relation to the beach towns, on <a href="https://30a.com/map/" target="_blank">this map</a>, 30A Bike Rentals is right beside Deer Lake State Park between Eastern Lake and Deer Lake. 
            It's around a 5 mile trip from 30A Bike Rentals to Rosemary Beach.
            If you bike without stopping, it takes around 30 minutes, but we took our time and got lunch at Pizza By the Sea in Seacrest and enjoyed the towns so it took a couple hours.

If you decide to drive into 30A, you'll have to find street parking, but it is limited and might be hard to find.</div>

            <div class="mt-10">A lot of the beach access in the beach towns is private and you need a resident code to enter. Rosemary Beach is private, Seacrest Beach is private, and Alys beach is private. Inlet beach has private and public access. Public access for Inlet beach is right off Winston Ln I believe, which is right off the Timpoochee Trail past Rosemary Beach going east.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">The sun is intense, especially when you are biking out in it. Wear a long-sleeved shirt if you bike and a ball-cap/sun-hat that won't blow off your head as well sunglasses and lots of sunscreen. </div>
            <div class="mt-10">Bring a *small* bag with water bottles and some refreshing snacks (like fruit cups) to stay hydrated and refreshed.</div>

            Gator Beach is an alligator establishment that has tons of alligators from babies up to young adults. Admission is free, and you can buy a photo with you holding a baby alligator and food sticks to feed the gators from the deck (do this instead of the Gulfarium Discover Gators activity).
            Gator Beach is below a restaurant, so grab lunch or dinner before or after your encounter with the alligators.

            Gator Beach has *free* alligator shows daily starting at noon. They will tell you about the gators and feed them.

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Whenever I go to the beach, I always want to see a SHARK. Not a nurse shark, a SHARK-SHARK. After doing some research, it sounds like Okaloosa Island Pier is a good place to spot a tiger shark.
            Unfortunately, I didn't research the topic until after our last trip, so I don't know if you will see a tiger shark, but it's worth a shot.
            Next time I go to Destin I will definitely be going to the Okaloosa Island Pier.  
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Okaloosa Island Pier is a fishing pier, so there is bound to be sharks present with all that bait being thrown into the water.

        <p>For now, here are some unique tips for this specific destination.</p>
        <p><b>Best time to go:</b>
            For clear water, avoid going to Destin after heavy storms and go to the water during high tide. The best weather for water activities is late-May to mid-June, and mid-August to early-September. June and July can be too hot in my opinion, even for the water.
            In my frank opinion, if the water isn't clear, driving 15-hours isn't worth it...
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.emeraldgrande.com/harborwalk-village/harbor-cams" target="_blank">Here</a> is a live cam of Crab Island and other spots right now so you can see what the water clarity appears to be.</p>
        <p class="mt-10"><a href="https://destintiki.com/crab-island-tides/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a website you can find tide information. </p>
        <p>Definitely bring beach chairs and a beach tent, sun-hats/ball-caps, sunglasses, and tons of sunscreen if you plan to sit on the beach yourself or while you watch your kids. I'd also bring a long-sleeved shirt or multiple.</p>

        <p>For fewer people, don’t go for Memorial Day or Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Sharks are attracted to metal, so taking jewelry off in the water might make you less of a shark target...</p>

        <h2>Schedule</h2>

        <h3>The day before you leave: </h3>
        <p><b>Packing:</b> Always pack the day before you leave for big trips like this. Other than your usual items (clothes, toiletries, shoes) make sure you pack…</p>
        <p class="list-p">*Waterproof* digital watch: My biggest recommendation if you will be in charge of the schedule…I don’t like checking my phone for the time to stay on schedule, so I’d recommend a WATERPROOF digital watch which is extremely more convenient than pulling your phone out over and over again 100 times (and dropping it in the process). When you have activities planned and need to keep track of time, it becomes more practical for a watch…</p>
        <p class="list-p">Long-sleeved shirts: It’s counter-intuitive, but long-sleeved shirts help with the sun…and you’re going to sweat anyways…</p>
        <p class="list-p">Sunscreen: Don't forget!</p>
        <p class="list-p">Sunglasses</p>
        <p class="list-p">Flip-flops / sandals: Don't forget them!</p>
        <p class="list-p">Sneakers: For the boardwalk, sneakers might be more comfortable than sandals...</p>
        <p class="list-p">Sun-hat or ball-cap: Absolutely needed if you will be outside a lot. The sun beaming on your face will get old real quick…</p>
        <p class="list-p">Small bag: To carry stuff in while in boats, biking, etc.</p>
        <p class="list-p">Snorkel, goggles, flippers, etc.: If you go to Norriego or Crab Island, there will be tons of little fish, it's nice to have goggles and snorkels.</p>
        <p class="list-p">*Small*, *sturdy* (wooden handle) fish nets: At Crab Island, there are tons of little fish in the sea grass that are fun to try and catch for kids and adults. The boat will have some fish nets with plastic handles that bend too easily.</p>
        <p class="list-p">Beach chairs</p>
        <p class="list-p">Beach tent/umbrella: If you're sitting on the beach, you NEED a tent or umbrella or you will only last 20 minutes before you are baked to a crisp.</p>
        <p class="list-p">Sand toys (if applicable)</p>
        <p class="list-p">Umbrella + poncho: Florida weather is bi-polar.</p>
        <p class="list-p">Waterproof phone protector: My husband had his phone plunged in the water while we were in Destin…you don’t think it’ll happen to you until it does…</p>
        <p class="list-p">Mini cooler: It is not essential, but it's super beneficial, especially for Crab Island and going to the beach. Pack it with refreshing snacks (fruit cups, etc.) and cold drinks.</p>
        <p class="list-p">HDMI cable + laptop: I always bring these so I can plug my laptop into the hotel TV and watch what I want.</p>
    

        <p><b>Food:</b> For this itinerary, since the budget is on the smaller side, eat lunch at the hotel two of the four days and eat dinner out (breakfast is for free at the hotel).</p>
        <p class="list-p"><b>Cooking Tools:</b> The Village Inn hotel has a microwave.</p>
        <p class="list-p"><b>Dinnerware:</b> Disposable forks + spoons <span class="money-spent">($4)</span>; disposable bowls/plates <span class="money-spent">($10)</span></p>
        
        <p class="list-p mt-10"><b>Food:</b></p>
        <p class="list-p">Beefaroni/Ravioli/Ramen/Any microwavable food that will fit in mini-fridge or is non-perishable (2 cans per day x 2 adults = 4 cans per day x 2 days = 8 cans x $2/can = <span class="money-spent">$16</span>)</p>
        <p class="list-p">Canned peaches (15oz) (2 cans per day x 2 adults = 4 cans per day x 2 days = 8 cans x $2/can = <span class="money-spent">$16</span>)</p>
