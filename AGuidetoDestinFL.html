        <p>
            For every trip you want to know the best time to go, when you should NOT go, lodging, food, excursions, and a default plan. 
        </p>

        <h1>The Best Times to Go</h1>
        <p>
            The best time to go to Destin, FL depends on why you are going...
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>For clear water</b>, go during 
            Destin's water is clearest in spring (March to May) and fall (September to early November) due to favorable weather and less rain.
            The clearest water occurs around high tide, especially on days with little to no rainfall. 
            When Destin's water is crystal clear, you might mistake it for the Caribbean!

        <h1>When NOT to Go</h1>
        <p>
            Water runoff from rain can make the water lose its crystal clear appearance. To avoid disappointment, avoid going during or after a rainy time or season.
            It rains all the time in Florida, but as long as it isn't too heavy it should be okay.
        </p>


        <h1>Lodging</h1>
        <p>

        </p>


        <h1>Food</h1>
