            For every trip you want to know the best time to go for you, lodging, food, excursions, and a default plan. 
        </p>

        <h1>The Best Times to Go and When Not to Go</h1>
        <p>
            The best time to go to Destin, FL depends on why you are going...
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>For clear water</b>, go during the spring (March to May) or fall (September to early November).
            Destin's water is clearest in spring (March to May) and fall (September to early November) due to favorable weather and less rain.
            The clearest water occurs around high tide, especially on days with little to no rainfall. 
            Not only is the water clear during the spring and fall, but it isn't as hot as June, July, and August will be.
            It will be too hot for most people to be outside in the summer except for the early morning and late evening.

            If it has been storming quite often, don't expect clear water. 
            The runoff from the rain combined with ocean currents can mix up a lot of sea vegetation and other stuff and make the water look greenish and not clear at all!
            My husband and I made the mistake of going right after a series of storms and we were incredibly disappointed after our 15 hour drive for the water to look like a lake!

            But, when Destin's water is crystal clear, you might mistake it for the Caribbean!

            <b>For the fishing rodeo</b>, go during October.
            The Destin Fishing Rodeo is an annual fishing tournament that takes place every year from October 1st to October 31st.
            It is open to anglers of all ages, with over $100,000 in cash and prizes awarded. 
        </p>


        <h1>Lodging</h1>
        <p>
            I highly recommend being within walking distance of <b>HarborWalk Village</b>, unless you want to worry about having to drive or be driven to most dining, excursions, and other activities along the boardwalk.
            Nearly all popular excursion boats (Crab Island, parasailing, dolphin tours, and more) are located on the HarborWalk Village boardwalk or within walking distance of it.
            The HarborWalk Village is right on Destin Harbor and it has a host of restaurants, bars, excursion booking kiosks, stores, and other activities like caricature artists, face painting, zip-lining, taking pictures with parrots, and more.
            Crab Island, one of Destin's most popular tourist attractions, can be seen right from the boardwalk. 
            <a href="https://www.emeraldgrande.com/harborwalk-village" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to the HarborWalk Village's website for all the details on dining, activities, and more.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to be within walking distance of HarborWalk Village, you want to stay at the 
            <a href="https://villageinndestin.com/" target="_blank"><b>The Village Inn</b></a>
            or 
            <a href="https://www.emeraldgrande.com/emerald-grande" target="_blank"><b>The Emerald Grande Resort</b></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The Village Inn</b> - 215 Harbor Blvd, Destin, FL 32541 ~ (850) 837-7413 ~ around $100-150/night in-season (summer), around $60-100/night off-season
        </p>
        <p><b>Personal Experiences</b></p>
        <p>
            My husband and I always stay at the Village Inn (the more afforable option).
            The first time we stayed there weren't any issues, but our second time (during a rainy season) it was so humid the floor was wet 24/7...
            
        </p>


        <h1>Food</h1>
        <!--Business Name, Est. Cost, Address-->
        <p><b>Breakfast</b></p>
        <p>
            Both the Village Inn and Emerald Grande resort have breakfast, but if you want to enjoy eating out, there are several breakfast spots along HarborWalk Village.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the early morning, if you skip breakfast at the hotel, consider walking to the HarborWalk and grabbing breakfast
            the HarborWalk is a nice quiet walk, but at night it is bustling with families.

        </p>

        <p><b>Personal Experiences</b></p>
        <p>
            My husband and I were on a budget when we went, so we ate breakfast at the hotel, grabbed some sandwich stuff and other snacks from Walmart (which is around 20 minutes up the road from both hotels) for lunch, and ate dinner out only.
        </p>




        <h1>Excursions</h1>
        <!--Activity, Business Name, Est. Cost, Address-->
        <p>

        </p>


        <h1>3-Day Default Schedule</h1>
        <p>Planning trips can sometimes zap the fun right out of them. If you don't want to think of a plan, use this one! Be sure to book the activities ahead of time so the plan doesn't get thrown off track.</p>
