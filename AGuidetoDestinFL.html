        <p>
            Destin was founded by Captain Leonard Destin in the mid-19th century and officially became a city in 1984. 
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The unique color of the water is due to sunlight reflecting off the fine, white sand made of Appalachian quartz. </p>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            A boardwalk on Destin Harbor with a host of restaurants, shops, excursion booking kiosks, and other activities like a caricature artist, ziplining, and more. See the website for more details.

            <div class="mt-10">Most excursion boats (like to Crab Island, parasailing, etc.) are at HarborWalk Village so if you are going to Destin for excursions like Crab Island, I would stay at the Emerald Grande Resort ($$$$) or the Village Inn ($$) so you don't have to worry about parking each day (both hotels are within a 10 minute walk of HarborWalk Village).</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Destin Harbor Fireworks: Spring fireworks are on Thursdays from March to April 17th. Summer fireworks are on Mondays and Thursdays from May through August. Additional shows are on Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and July 4th.

            Crab Island can safely be considered Destin's top attraction. It is a sandbar with crystal clear water (in the right conditions) that would make you mistake it for a swimming pool or the Caribbean.
            To get to Crab Island, you must take a boat, which will most likely be docked in HarborWalk Village. We booked our Crab Island Tour with Happy's Watersports, who's contact information is below.
            They had floating platforms, though they are first-come-first-serve and they fill up quick. They also had paddle boards you could rent for an additional fee (I think $15 an hour, but I am not 100% sure).

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> Happy's Watersports operates out of a trailer in a parking lot, which you can park at for ~$10; or avoid parking by staying at the Emerald Grande Resort OR the Village Inn and walk right over.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Restrooms:</span> The boat had a small restroom on board. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Activity Times:</span> The 3-hour Crab Island Tour for us was 1 PM - 4 PM. I am not sure when the 4-hour Crab Island Tour was. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Cost:</span> ~$60 per person, plus taxes, fees, a tip, and any add-ons (like renting paddle boards, etc.). For two people, it was about $160 total (and we didn't rent paddle boards or anything). </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Tips</div>
            <div class="mt-10">The clarity of the water depends on the weather and tides. <a href="https://destintiki.com/crab-island-tides/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a website you can find tide information. </div>
            <div class="mt-10">The 3-hour tour was more than enough for us when we went. By the end of the 3rd hour we were ready to go and I was glad we didn't do the 4-hour one. There isn't much to do, and after the 'wow' factor wears off, you are just stuck chilling until it's time to leave, and the water was not as clear in the last hour as the tides change.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Make sure you bring a sun-hat/ball-cap, sunglasses, and sun-screen because the sun is tough out there, especially from 1 PM - 4 PM!
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                If you enjoy snorkeling (or have kids) make sure to bring goggles, a snorkel, and a small, *sturdy* (wooden-handled) fish net because there are lots of little fishes that swim in the sea vegetation that are fun to try and catch. The tour boat will have goggles, snorkels, and fish nets, but the fish nets are flimsy, and having your own goggles and snorkel is more ideal.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Bringing a mini-cooler with water is highly recommended, and potentially some refreshing snacks like fruit. Be sure to check what other items are allowed and which items aren't (i.e. glass, etc.)
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                You might see dolphins on the way to Crab Island and during other excursions, so I wouldn't book a Dolphin Cruise until maybe your last day if you haven't seen any dolphins.

        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Hours</div>
            <div>Crab Island is technically open, 24/7; but most excursion businesses close around 5 PM. Happy's Watersports is open 8:30 AM - 5 PM Sunday-Saturday.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Norriego Point is a popular snorkeling spot. We snorkeled around the rocks and saw tons of fish and even a sea turtle swimming along the rocks.

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> Street parking - The parking lot at Norriego Point Beach Access and Park is currently closed due to construction, so you currently there is only limited street parking, and you have to pay (I don't remember the cost, probably $20 for the day). Parking was very limited the times we went (2024 + 2025) and we didn't get a spot the first trip, which was a bummer because we were leaving the next day so we didn't get to go. I highly recommend taking a taxi or uber so you don't have to worry about parking. </div>

            Henderson Beach is a peaceful white-sand beach that is less crowded (at least when we went (8 AM - 10 AM early June 2024 + 2025)) and absolutely stunning.
            Walking to the shore line felt like I was approaching the gates of a tropical paradise.

        <div class="post-div black-bold mt-60">Visit 30A</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            30A is a a scenic county highway in Florida that runs along the Gulf Coast, connecting a series of small, picturesque beach towns like Seaside, Alys Beach, Rosemary Beach, and Grayton Beach. 30A is about an hour from Destin, but it is well worth the drive to see these extremley cute beach towns.
            <a href="https://30a.com/map/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a map of 30A.
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Every street in 30A is a photo-op. Everything looks so photo-ready. It looks like a movie scene, which is probably why it was one. The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey was shot in Seaside.
            30A is very bike-friendly. We rented bikes from 30A Bike Rentals for the day (we did the Park n' Ride Special). The rental place is directly beside the Timpoochee Trail, which runs right beside 30A and goes through all the beach towns.
            We hopped on the trail and biked all the way to Rosemary Beach (one of the last beach towns on 30A). 
            To give you an idea of where the rental is in relation to the beach towns, on <a href="https://30a.com/map/" target="_blank">this map</a>, 30A Bike Rentals is right beside Deer Lake State Park between Eastern Lake and Deer Lake. 
            It's around a 5 mile trip from 30A Bike Rentals to Rosemary Beach.
            If you bike without stopping, it takes around 30 minutes, but we took our time and got lunch at Pizza By the Sea in Seacrest and enjoyed the towns so it took a couple hours.

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> If you do the Park n' Ride with 30A Bike Rentals, you can park your car in their parking lot on a first-come, first-serve basis (they had maybe 10 spots, so get there right as they open). If you decide to drive into 30A, you'll have to find street parking, but it is limited and might be hard to find.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Restrooms:</span> If you need to potty on your bike ride, you can find a local business in the beach towns. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Activity Times:</span> 30A Bike Rentals opens 9 AM and closes 5 PM most days, and you'd probably need to get there at least 15 minutes before they close. </div>

            <div class="mt-10">The bikes at 30A Bike Rentals do come with baskets and bike chains. There are tons of places to chain up your bike and go to the beach and go into shops.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">A lot of the beach access in the beach towns is private and you need a resident code to enter. Rosemary Beach is private, Seacrest Beach is private, and Alys beach is private. Inlet beach has private and public access. Public access for Inlet beach is right off Winston Ln I believe, which is right off the Timpoochee Trail past Rosemary Beach going east.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">The sun is intense, especially when you are biking out in it. Wear a long-sleeved shirt if you bike and a ball-cap/sun-hat that won't blow off your head as well sunglasses and lots of sunscreen. </div>
            <div class="mt-10">Bring a *small* bag with water bottles and some refreshing snacks (like fruit cups) to stay hydrated and refreshed.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">Bring towels in case you decide to find a public beach access point.</div>

        <p>There are certain excursions I do not recommend driving yourself to because parking can be scarce. I am specifically talking about Norriego Point, which we couldn't go to our first time to Destin because parking was so scarce and we were leaving the next day! At the time I didn't think to take a taxi or Uber, which I recommend doing when going to Norriego Point. Here are some taxi options in the Destin area. </p>

                        I don't remember getting a confirmation email when I booked online, so I ended up calling them anyways. I would just book via call instead of using the website.

        <p>For now, here are some unique tips for this specific destination.</p>
        <p><b>Best time to go:</b> For clear water, avoid going to Destin after heavy storms. The best weather for water activities is late-May to mid-June, and mid-August to early-September. June and July can be too hot in my opinion, even for the water. </p>
