            Destin was founded by Captain Leonard Destin in the mid-19th century and officially became a city in 1984. 
        </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The unique color of the water is due to sunlight reflecting off the fine, white sand made of Appalachian quartz. </p>

            <div class="mt-10">Most excursion boats (like to Crab Island, parasailing, etc.) are at HarborWalk Village so if you are going to Destin for excursions like Crab Island, I would stay at the Emerald Grande Resort ($$$$) or the Village Inn ($$) so you don't have to worry about parking each day (both hotels are within a 10 minute walk of HarborWalk Village).</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Destin Harbor Fireworks: Spring fireworks are on Thursdays from March to April 17th. Summer fireworks are on Mondays and Thursdays from May through August. Additional shows are on Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and July 4th.

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            Crab Island can safely be considered Destin's top attraction. It is a sandbar with crystal clear water (in the right conditions) that would make you mistake it for the Caribbean.
            To get to Crab Island, you must take a boat, which will most likely be docked in HarborWalk Village. We booked our Crab Island Tour with Happy's Watersports, who's contact information is below.
            They had floating platforms, though they are first-come-first-serve and they fill up quick. They also had paddle boards you could rent for an additional fee (I think $15 an hour, but I am not 100% sure).

        <div class="post-div">Note: Always check the website or contact the business to see if information is still accurate.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Parking:</span> Happy's Watersports operates out of a trailer in a parking lot, which you can park at for ~$10; or avoid parking by staying at the Emerald Grande Resort OR the Village Inn and walk right over.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Activity Times:</span> The 3-hour Crab Island Tour for us was 1 PM - 4 PM. I am not sure when the 4-hour Crab Island Tour was. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Cost:</span> ~$60 per person, plus taxes, fees, a tip, and any add-ons (like renting paddle boards, etc.). For two people, it was about $160 total (and we didn't rent paddle boards or anything). </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Tips</div>
            <div class="mt-10">The 3-hour tour was more than enough for us when we went. By the end of the 3rd hour we were ready to go and I was glad we didn't do the 4-hour one. There isn't much to do, and after the 'wow' factor wears off, you are just stuck chilling until it's time to leave, and the water was not as clear in the last hour as the tides change.</div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Make sure you bring a sun-hat/ball-cap, sunglasses, and sun-screen because the sun is tough out there, especially from 1 PM - 4 PM!
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                If you enjoy snorkeling (or have kids) make sure to bring goggles, a snorkel, and a small, *sturdy* (wooden-handled) fish net because there are lots of little fishes that swim in the sea vegetation that are fun to try and catch. The tour boat will have goggles, snorkels, and fish nets, but the fish nets are flimsy, and having your own goggles and snorkel is more ideal.
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                Bringing a mini-cooler with water is highly recommended, and potentially some refreshing snacks like fruit. Be sure to check what other items are allowed and which items aren't (i.e. glass, etc.)
            </div>
            <div class="mt-10">
                You might see dolphins on the way to Crab Island and during other excursions, so I wouldn't book a Dolphin Cruise until maybe your last day if you haven't seen any dolphins.

        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            <div class="gray-bold">Hours</div>
            <div>Crab Island is technically open, 24/7; but most excursion businesses close around 5 PM. Happy's Watersports is open 8:30 AM - 5 PM Sunday-Saturday.</div>

                        This resort is located right in HarborWalk Village, meaning most Destin excursions will be right outside your door.
                        Most suites have kitchens, multiple full bathrooms, and a host of other amenities that make it more like you are staying in an apartment than a hotel room.

        <p>These are some transportation options between different activities while you are at your destination.</p>
        <p>There are certain excursions I do not recommend driving yourself to because parking can be scarce. I am specifically talking about Norriego Point, which we couldn't go to our first time to Destin because parking was so scarce and we were leaving the next day! At the time I didn't think to take a taxi or Uber, which I recommend doing when going to Norriego Point. Here are some taxi options in the Destin area. </p>

                        I don't remember getting a confirmation email when I booked online, so I ended up calling them anyways. I would just book via call instead of using the website.

        <p>For now, here are some unique tips for this specific destination.</p>
        <p><b>Best time to go:</b> For clear water, avoid going to Destin after heavy storms. The best weather for water activities is late-May to mid-June, and mid-August to early-September. June and July can be too hot in my opinion, even for the water. </p>
