        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Using a metro can be intimidating, especially if you have never used one.
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            This guide will explain how to use the metro so you can be an expert your first trip.
        </div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">This tutorial will use the Washington D.C. metro system in the example.</div>




        <h3>Read the Rules</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">The first thing you want to do is look up the <b>metro rules</b> for your city.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/rules/">D.C. Metro Rules</a>.</div>


        <h3>Know Your Station Destination</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Do your research and find the closest metro station to your current location, and the closest station to your destination. On the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/wmata-system-map.cfm">metro map</a> you can see which metro stations have parking, denoted by the P in a square beside the station name. Parking is around $20 for the day for most stations, but do your own research.
        </div>

        

        <h3>Get a Metro Card</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Before you can use the D.C. metro, you need to get a <b>metro card (SmarTrip Card)</b> from the blue vending machines on the wall, which every station has, and add money to it.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/vending.cfm">D.C. Metro Card Info</a></div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">You can also download an app.</div>


        <h3>Enter the Metro Station</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">After you get your metro card, you will need to approach the gates that are lined up. Scan the metro card on the 'SmarTrip' image and the gate that the green arrow points to will open and you will enter through it and go down the stairs/escalator/elevator to where the metro trains will stop to let people off and on.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">You will also need to scan the metro card/app to exit the metro station, and once you exit, you will be charged based on how long you used the metro for.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">For the D.C. metro system, customers that tap in and out of the same metro station within 15 minutes, and do not use a rail pass, will receive a trip credit in the amount of the fare they were charged.</div>

        <h3>Explaining the Metro Station</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">There will be two sides in the metro station. To know which way you need to go, you need to pay attention to the words on the front of the metro cars. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">The words will be a <b>color</b> and a <b>metro station</b>, or it might just be a metro station.</div>
        
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Before moving on, you need to familiarize yourself with the metro system map of your respective metropolitan city. In this case, it is D.C.</div>
        <div class="post-img-div">
            <img class="post-img" src="./images/metro-tutorial/metro-map.png"/>
            <p class="post-img-caption"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/wmata-system-map.cfm">Image Source</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">If there is a color, the color is which 'metro line' the train runs along (i.e. Orange Line, Silver Line, etc.). See the map to know what I mean.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20">The other name is the first/last metro station on that metro color line and it tells you the DIRECTION the metro train is traveling.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            For example, if a metro train is showing 'Vienna', you know it is 'an Orange Line going towards Vienna', which is the last station of the Orange Line (in the west).
            If the metro train is showing 'Huntington,' you know it is 'a Yellow Line train going towards Huntington,' which is the last station of the Yellow Line (in the south).
            So, in short, the name is which first/last metro station on the color line the train is going towards.
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Familiarize yourself with the first and last stops on each color line, and/or take a metro map with you on your trip.</div>

        <h3>Switching Color Lines</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">The <b>big circles</b> show you the stations where multiple color lines intersect, so you can switch color lines if you need to. </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">
            For example, lets say I am at the Vienna metro station (western end of the Orange Line) but I want to go to Shady Grove (end of the Red Line).
            I would have to ride the Orange Line towards New Carrollton all the way to the Metro Center station, then get on a Red Line towards Shady Grove.
        </div>

        <h3>Wrapping it Up</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">In summary, know the rules; know the map; and know what the words on the metro train refer to and you are all set! </div>
