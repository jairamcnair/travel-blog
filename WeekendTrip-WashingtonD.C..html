        <h4>Reading Deadline</h4>
        <p>It is recommended to read this itinerary up to 3 months before the trip, and at least 2-months before the trip.</p>
        <p>This recommendation is based on the fact that certain activities at this destination tend to book up quickly and it isn't advised to wait for the last minute.</p>

        



        <h4>When to Go</h4>
        <p>If you are going to sight-see, the best time to plan a visit to D.C. is September-October, as tourist season has died down, rates start to fall, and the weather is still nice.</p>
        <p>Since this itinerary is designed to be executed on a weekend, consider taking a Friday in September or October off and heading to D.C. and Old Town Alexandria for the weekend.</p>
        <p>If you are going for the Cherry Blossom Festival, you'd want to go late March-early April. Hotel rates will be much higher during this time.</p>
        <p>Peak tourist season in Washington, D.C., is generally Spring (late March-May) for the Cherry Blossoms and festivals, and Summer (June-August) for warm weather and outdoor events, leading to large crowds and higher prices during both periods, though Fall (Sept-Oct) offers nice weather with fewer people. </p>
        <p>Beware of school field trips if you decide to go in the Spring.</p>






        <h4>Budget</h4>
        <p>As of Dec. 2025, the estimated minimum cost to execute this itinerary is $2,500. If you have more than that, consider staying at a better/closer hotel, or staying more days.</p>
        <p>The estimated minimum budget assumes there are two travelers. If you are a solo traveler, deduct the fixed expenses (i.e. expenses not reliant on the number of people like hotel, gas, and parking expenses), divide that number by two, then add back the hotel, gas, and parking expenses. That is your new estimated minimum budget.</p>




        <h4>Maximum Distance</h4>
        <p>This itinerary assumes the travelers are within at most 6 hours of the destination.</p>





        <h4>Week Days</h4>
        <p>This itinerary's activities are assumed to happen on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>





        <h4>Activities & Excursions</h4>
        <p>This itinerary has scheduled in the following activities (see their scheduled times):
            <br/>skydiving
            <br/>ice-skating
            <br/>hells kitchen
        </p>

        <p>It might be important to mention the fact that the monuments will be viewed at night for this itinerary. Before you are completely against the idea of seeing monuments at night, I'd like to bring it to your attention that you might enjoy it more than the day time. I personally prefer seeing the monuments at night. Seeing them lit up behind a dark sky adds to the dramatic effect. Look up images on Google.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact you will be in D.C. until 10:00 PM, it's advised not to do this itinerary alone.</p>





        <h4>What to Book</h4>
        <p>It's recommended to book the following before the trip:</p>






        <h4>Travel Methods</h4>
        <p>This itinerary assumes the travelers will use their car to drive to the destination and back home.</p>
        <p>This itinerary assumes the travelers will use the metro system while at the travel destination.</p>

        <h4>Saving Time</h4>
        <p>This itinerary took 12 hours to plan, so that is how much time you are saving yourself.</p>
