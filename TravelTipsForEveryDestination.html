        <h1>Planning Tips</h1>

        <h3>Create a Detailed Itinerary</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Always create a <i>detailed</i> itinerary before any trip, no matter how big or small. Whether it's a weekend get-away or a week-long vacation, always have a plan.
            I always find myself wanting to be 'spontaneous', but I end up wasting hours deciding what to do and planning out the logistics on the fly, and by then it's too late and I have to wait til 'another time'.
            <i>I've learned the hard way that it’s ALWAYS easier to be spontaneous when you already have a default plan</i>, so plan out your trip in detail THEN be spontaneous.

            <a href="HowToCreateAnItinerary.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a post on how to create a detailed itinerary and what questions you need to answer.
            To sum it up, you need to know the destination + the best time to visit; where you will be lodging; how you'll get to and from the destination; how you'll transport while there; breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day; the activities you want to do, their available times, and their estimated costs; and much more. Check the post out to see!

        <h1>Navigation Tips</h1>

        <h3>Create a Destination 'Guide' in Google Maps</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            After creating a detailed itinerary, you most likely know all the places you will visit.
            It can save you a lot of time and headache by saving those addresses in Google Maps instead of having to either re-look them up or type them in even if you remember.
            You can type in all the addresses and give the locations any name you want so when it's time to go, you can just click a button instead of typing the locations in.
        </div>

        <h3>Get a Physical Map of the Destination's State/Region</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            It's a good idea to have a physical map and not only rely on your phone for navigation. Crazy story, one time while traveling, my phone stopped working and I didn't have my laptop so I had to find a map in Barnes and Noble to get back home! I was states away and had no clue where to go.
            It might be an extremely rare occurrence to have all your electronics stop working at once, but taking safety precautions never hurts!
        </div>

        <h3>Get a Compass</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            A compass is a good addition to your travel bag, especially if you like to hike, go off the path, etc.
        </div>

        <h3>Get a *Waterproof* Digital Watch</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            This is a huge recommendation if you will be the one in charge of the schedule. 
            Having to find a clock to check or pulling your phone out hundreds of times throughout the day is annoying and plus, it increases the risk of dropping it (over and over again until it stops working).
            Additionally, if you are in the water (maybe snorkeling or swimming) you couldn't have a phone or clock anyways, unless it was a waterproof digital watch or something...which is exactly what I recommend getting.
            When you have activities planned and need to keep track of time, it becomes extremely practical to get a digital watch that you can quickly check the time on.

        <h1>Money Tips</h1>

        <h3>Get a Notebook to Log ALL Transactions</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            After creating a detailed itinerary, you should know your planned activities and their estimated costs, but those are just estimates.
            It's highly recommended to get a notebook and after every single transaction either log it right then and there, or keep the receipts and log it each night so you know exactly how much money you have (and hopefully you have more than you expected!).
            Always log the transactions in the order they occurred too.
            Each night at the hotel, sit down with your finances to determine the actual amount you have left to spend. You might find out you can do more the next day than you planned for!
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-10">
            There are tons of benefits to logging transactions on paper (not just keeping the receipts). 
            Having the transactions on paper will make it easier to reference back to without having to just remember or dig through a bag of receipts.
            Being able to look at past costs will help improve the accuracy of your budget for future trips.
        </div>

        <h3>Factor in Tax, Tips, and Add-Ons</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Whenever estimating costs, don't forget sales tax (6% in my state) and gratuity (20%), along with any special fees or add-ons (like having to buy the photos of you petting an animal at the zoo, etc.)
        </div>

        <h3>Remember Hotel Security Deposits</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Most hotels withhold a $50-$100 deposit that you'll get back if the room isn't destroyed. Always expect the higher cost and make sure you have the funds available.
        </div>




        <h1>Lodging Tips</h1>

        <h3>Stay M-F</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Many hotels charge more on the weekends, so staying M-F might help cut costs if you are on a budget.
        </div>

        <h3>Remember Hotel Security Deposits (Again)</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Most hotels withhold a $50-$100 deposit that you'll get back if the room isn't destroyed. Always expect the higher cost and make sure you have the funds available.
        </div>

        <h3>Bring an HDMI Cable</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            Always bring an HDMI cable and an electronic you can use it with so you can plug it up to the TV and watch what you want (like free movies on Tubi, streaming services, etc.) instead of having to browse the hotel’s cable.
