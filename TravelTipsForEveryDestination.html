<intro>Introduction</intro>
<p>Here are several travel tips for any destination.</p>




<h3>Scheduling Tips</h3>
<details>
<info><b>Make a detailed plan, put it on paper:</b>
    If you want to make the most of your time and money, make a plan, and put it on paper (print, write).
    Even if you are spontaneous, it's alway easier to be spontaneous with a default plan.
</info>
<info><b>Get a waterproof, digital watch:</b> 
    Being able to quickly glance at your watch instead of pull your phone out over and over again, or find a clock is extremely beneficial, especially if you are the one in charge of the schedule.
    Getting a <b><i>water-proof</i></b> watch is recommended if you love water and book a lot of water activities.

<h3>Navigation + Electronic Tips</h3>
<details>
<info><b>Create a destination guide in Google Maps:</b>
    After creating a detailed itinerary, you most likely know all the places you will visit.
    It can save you a lot of time and headache by saving those addresses in Google Maps instead of having to either re-look them up or type them in even if you remember.
    You can type in all the addresses and give the locations any name you want so when it's time to go, you can just click a button instead of typing the locations in.
</info>
<info><b>Get a compass:</b> 
    Just like a true adventurer, getting a compass isn't a bad idea, especially if your phone gets dropped in water or dies.
</info>
<info><b>Get a pocket-sized portable charger:</b> Always bring your fully-charged phone and a fully-charged portable charger with you so you don't have to stress about your electronics dying.</info>
<info><b>Bring an HDMI cord:</b> Always bring an HDMI cord so you can plug your laptop into the hotel TV and watch what you want.</info>
<info><b>Get a physical map of your destination:</b> 
    It's a good idea to have a physical map and not only rely on your phone for navigation.
    One time while traveling, my phone stopped working and my husband had already ruined his, so we had to find a map in Barnes and Noble to get back home!
    We were states away and had no clue where to go.
    It might be an extremely rare occurrence to have all your electronics stop working at once, but taking safety precautions never hurts!

<h3>Finance + Budgeting Tips</h3>
<details>
<info><b>Log all transactions:</b>
    Get a notebook and for every vacation/trip, keep your receipts and log every transaction in the order they occur with their date, amount, and payment method (debit card, credit card).
    This won't only give you a specific amount you have left for the trip, but it will also help you budget for future trips, as you'll have a concrete example of vacation costs.
    Each night at the hotel, sit down with your finances to determine the actual amount you have left to spend. You might find out you can do more the next day than you planned for!
</info>
<info><b>Don't forget tax, tips, and other fees: </b>
    When you create a budget, go ahead and add sales tax (6% if you don't know your state's) and gratuity (20%) and other fees to the total cost, then round up to the nearest number that ends in 0 (i.e. if the est. budget is $24, round up to $30).
    Better to find out you have more than you need, than not enough!
</info>
<info><b>Don't forget hotel security deposits:</b>
    Keep in mind that most hotels will hold $50-$100 or more (assume the highest amount when budgeting) for a security deposit.
    If the room isn't trashed, this will be refunded, but make sure you have the funds to cover it.
</info>
<info><b>Stay Mon-Fri:</b>
    Many hotels charge more on the weekends, so staying M-F might help cut costs if you are on a budget.
