<intro>Introduction</intro>
<p>The first time using a metro can be intimidating. This guide will help you be an expert your first trip.</p>
<p>This tutorial is on how to use the metro in Washington D.C..</p>


<h3>Read the Rules:</h3>
<details>
<info>Make sure you read the rules before you use the metro (and any public transportation).</info>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/rules/">D.C. Metro Rules</a>
<info>One unexpected rule of the D.C. metro to make note of is that eating and drinking aren't allowed, and doing so could result in a citation or arrest.</info>
</details>


<h3>Understand the Map:</h3>
<details>
<info>Make sure you know how to use the metro map.</info>

<info><b>Color Lines:</b> Each metro car will run on a specific color line, as viewed on the map. An orange line train will stay on the orange line on the map, a blue line train will stay on the blue line on the map, and so on.</info>
<info><b>Switching Color Lines:</b> The circles on the map represent metro stations. If the circle/arms would touch a color line if all the other color lines disappeared, those are the color lines that run through that station. For example, Capitol South metro station has orange, silver, and blue lines run through it. L'Enfant Plaza has orange, silver, blue, yellow, and green lines that run through it.</info>
<info><b>Directions</b>:
    When you walk down into the metro system, you will notice there are two sides with metro trains going opposite directions.
    On the metro trains, there will be a screen showing you the name of the metro station the train is going in the direction of.
    The name will be the first/last metro station stop on the color line.
    For example, if you see New Carrollton on the train, you'd know it's an orange line train going to New Carrollton (east-), and stopping at all the stops along the way to let people on and off.
    If you see a metro train with Shady Grove on its screen, you'd know it's a red line train going to Shady Grove (north west), and stopping at all the stops along the way.

<info><b>Test:</b> </info>
<info>Let's test your knowledge...get your map ready!</info>

</details>
<br/>
<br/>
<info>You are at Potomac Av. metro station, and you want to get to the Archives Navy Memorial-Penn Quarter metro station. Assuming you will only switch color lines ONCE, how should you get there?</info>
<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>
<info>Answer: Take an orange line towards Vienna OR a blue line towards Franconia-Springfield OR a silver line towards Ashburn to L'Enfant Plaza (4th stop). At L'Enfant Plaza board a green line towards Greenbelt OR a yellow line towards Mt Vernon Sq, get off at the 1st stop.</info>

<br/>
<br/>
<info>It's a great idea to print out the D.C. metro map and take it with you so you don't have to pull your phone out or find the map posted in the train/station.</info>
<info>Below is a PDF version of the D.C. Metro Map to print out and keep with you.</info>

<h3>Get Your Metro Card (SmarTrip card):</h3>
<details>
<info>You have to pay to ride the metro, and the most straight-forward way to do that is to get a metro card (SmarTrip card), but there are other payment options.</info>
<a class="no-margin-top" target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/how-to-pay/index.cfm">Other payment options.</a>
<info>Cellular data might not always be working optimally underground, so <b>I recommend getting a physical metro card</b>.</info>

<info><b>Where to get a metro card:</b></info>
<info>Online: Order your metro card online</info>
<a target="_blank" href="https://smartrip.wmata.com/Storefront/ShoppingCart/AddAndPurchase/6745467">Order a SmarTrip card with $8 fare value ($2 to buy the card itself for $10 total)</a>
<info>At the metro station: Look for the BLUE vending machine on the wall. You can buy a metro card at those for $2 plus the fare amount.</info>

<h3>What to do at the Metro Station:</h3>
<details>
<info>You know the rules, the map, and how to pay; now the only thing left to do is ride!</info>
<info><b>Step 1:</b> Know your route before you even get there, write it down if you need and consider taking a map of the metro system. Know how you will get to the metro station (walk, taxi, bus, drive & park, etc.).</info>
<info><b>Step 2:</b> Enter the metro station (of the correct color line you plan to take). Research parking/how you will get there beforehand.</info>
<info><b>Step 3:</b> If you need to add more money on your card or get one, do that first; then approach the line of gates and scan your metro card (or phone if you went that route) and walk through the gate (the gate the green arrow is pointing to). </info>
<info><b>Step 4:</b> Go down into the metro station (via escalator, or elevator if you have a stroller, etc. (RULES)) and as quickly as possible determine which side you need to watch for your train. Use the screens in the station to help you.</info>
<info><b>Step 5:</b> Wait for your train, board it, pay attention to the stops and make sure you get off at the right stop(s).</info>
<info><b>Step 6:</b> To exit the metro station, you will come back up the escalators and re-scan your metro card/phone and be on your way! </info>
<info>Note:
    If you were prevented from exiting because your SmarTrip card had insufficient fare, then follow the instructions on an Exitfare machine to add the remaining fare.
    The brown "Exitfare" machines are located near the Metrorail exit gates and accept credit, debit, and cash (coins and $1, $5 and $10 bills).
