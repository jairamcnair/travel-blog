        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="post-div">The first time using a metro can be intimidating.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">This guide will help you be an expert your first trip.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">This tutorial is on how to use the metro in Washington D.C..</div>




        <h3>Read the Rules</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">The first thing you want to do is look up the <b>metro rules</b>.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/rules/">D.C. Metro Rules</a>.</div>

        <h3>Know What to Expect</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Before you even walk into the metro station, you need to know what to expect.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">To use the metro, you will:</div>

        In summary, 
            

            


        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 1 - Know which station you will initially board at:</b> Look up the closest metro station to your current location or the one you will ride to your destination using.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2 - Know which station you need to get to: </b> Look up the closest metro station to your desired destination and determine what time you need to get to the destination.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3 - Determine the color line(s) you need to take and any transfer stations necessary and how long the trip will take:</b> 
                Find your stations on the metro map below and determine the metro lines you need to take amd how long it will take to get there and what time you need to be at the station.
                The dots on the map represent the metro stations, and if the dot is touching two colors, those are the color lines that run through that metro station and you can transfer color lines at those stations.
                For example, if you are at Dunn Loring station and you want to go to Shady Grove, you need to take the Orange line towards New Carrollton to Metro Center, then at Metro Center take a Red line towards Shady Grove to Shady Grove.
                When you go to the metro station, the metro trains will have the name of the station they are going towards on them, it will always be the first/last station on the color line (so for the orange line, the metro train will either say Vienna or New Carrollton - for the red line, the metro train will either say Shady Grove or Glenmont - and so on).
                You will always be on 'a COLOR line train going towards A METRO STATION' - for example, an ORANGE line train going towards VIENNA OR NEW CARROLLTON.

            <img class="post-img" src="./images/metro-tutorial/metro-map-2.png"/>
            <p class="post-img-caption"></p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 4 - Determine what time you need to be at the starting metro station to get to the destination on time</b></li>
            <li><b>Step 5 - Read the rules of the metro system before riding <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/rules/">D.C. Metro Rules</a> </b></li>
            <li><b>Step 6 - Enter the starting point metro station:</b> Buy a metro card (SmarTrip card) if you don't have one and add funds to it using the vending machine on the wall at the station.</li>
            <li><b>Step 7 - Enter through the gates:</b> Approach the line of gates and scan your metro card (SmarTrip card) to enter down into the subway system, go down the stairs/escalators/elevators.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Step 8 - Wait for the appropriate metro train and board it:</b> 
                There will be two sides for metro trains going opposite directions.
                Pay attention to the words on the front of the metro train to know which side you need to pay attention to.
                The words will be a <b>color</b> or the name of a <b>metro station</b>, or it might just be a metro station.
                The <b>color</b> is the 'metro line' the train runs along (i.e orange line, silver line, blue line, red line, green line, etc.).
                The <b>metro station</b> is the DIRECTION the metro train is traveling, and it corresponds to the metro station at the very end of the metro line.
               
                If a metro train is showing 'Vienna', it is 'an Orange Line train going TOWARDS Vienna', which is the last station of the Orange Line (in the west).
                If the metro train is showing 'New Carrollton,' it is an Orange Line train going TOWARDS New Carrollton, the last station on the Orange Line (in the east).
                If the metro train is showing 'Huntington,' you know it is 'a Yellow Line train going towards Huntington,' which is the last station of the Yellow Line (in the south).
                You get it...
                
                The color is which 'metro line' the train runs along (i.e. Orange Line, Silver Line, etc.). See the map to know what I mean.
                The other name is the first/last metro station on that metro color line and it tells you the DIRECTION the metro train is traveling.

                Wait for your metro train (most lines run every 5-12 minutes).
            </li>
            <li><b>Step 9 - Get off at the appropriate stations for transfers/destinations:</b> Get on the appropriate metro train and get off at the station that is closest to your desired destination, transfer color lines if necessary at transfer stations along the route (transfer stations are where multiple color lines run through the same station - see the map).</li>
            <li><b>Step 10 - Once at the final destination, exit the subway system:</b> Exit the train and walk back up the stairs/escalators/elevator and approach the gates to exit and scan your metro card to exit the subway system and finish walking to your destination.</li>
            <li><b>Step 8:</b> Repeat the process to get home.</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        <h3>How You Get Charged</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">After you get your metro card, you will need to approach the gates that are lined up. Scan the metro card on the 'SmarTrip' image and the gate that the green arrow points to will open and you will enter through it and go down the stairs/escalator/elevator to where the metro trains will stop to let people off and on.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">You will also need to scan the metro card/app to exit the metro station, and once you exit, you will be charged based on how long you used the metro for.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">For the D.C. metro system, customers that tap in and out of the same metro station within 15 minutes, and do not use a rail pass, will receive a trip credit in the amount of the fare they were charged.</div>
