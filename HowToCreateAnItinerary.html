            This blog post walks through how to create a detailed itinerary for any trip and helps you remember things you might forget.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="post-div">
            My first piece of general travel advice is to create a detailed itinerary. Even if you are a spontaneous person, it's easier to be spontaneous when you have a default plan.

        <div class="post-div mt-10">
            The further and more expensive the destination, the more I want to do exactly what I want to do while there.
            The best way to make sure you can do something is to book it before you go; but to book something before you go, you have to know all the details surrounding the schedule.
            Booking one activity is easy, but what if you've booked two or three activities for a single day? Now you HAVE to iron out every little detail, like when is lunch, how long will it take to travel between activities, and more. 
        </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-10">
            As you can already see, it's easier said than done to plan a trip. Every single detail needs to be accounted for.

        <h1>Tutorial</h1>

        <h3>Step 1: Know Your Destination</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Destination:</span> Where in the world are you going?</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Safety:</span> What do you need to be aware of for your own safety? (i.e. don’t wear this there, don't travel alone as a woman here, etc.)</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Dress Code:</span> Be respectful of the dress code</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Language:</span> Know the language and make sure you can communicate</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Why are you going?:</span> Make a list of activities you want to do to research in later steps</div>


        <h3>Step 2: Basic Transportation</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How will you travel to the destination?:</span> Your car, rental car, Uber/taxi, plane, metro, train, boat, etc.?</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How will you travel back home from the destination?:</span> Your car, rental car, Uber/taxi, plane, metro, train, boat, etc.?</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How will you transport to activities while at the destination?:</span> Your car, rental car, Uber/taxi, plane, metro, train, boat, etc.?</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Note: Consider how parking will be if you will be driving your own vehicle or a rental.</div>

        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How many miles from home is your destination?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How many hours will you be traveling there and back with your method of transportation?:</span></div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold money-spent">Est. Total Cost:</span> </div>



        <h3>Step 3: Lodging</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Where will your primary lodging be?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">How many nights will you be staying?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold money-spent">Est. Total Cost:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Note: Don't forget to factor in security deposit, tax, add-ons, gratuity, etc.</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Does this place serve free breakfast?:</span></div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Note the presence and lack of certain amenities (like bed sheets, pillows, AC, heat, etc.):</span></div>



        <h3>Step 4: Food</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Where will you eat breakfast each day?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Where will you eat lunch each day?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">Where will you eat dinner each day?:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold money-spent">Est. Total Cost for Food:</span> </div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Note: Budget in $20 for breakfast + lunch, and $30 for dinner per person (so $70 per day for food per person).</div>



        <h3>Step 5: Excursions</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold">For each activity you want to do, write down the following:</span> Business contact info, available times (some activities can only happen at certain times in the day), est. cost, distance from your lodging location via your planned travel method (walk, car, metro, etc.), parking (if you will be driving)</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20"><span class="gray-bold money-spent">Est. Total Cost for all activities:</span> </div>


        <h3>Step 6: Write Out a Detailed Rough + Final Draft</h3>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Now go by and plan out your days from waking up, eating breakfast, travel to first activity, first activity, travel to second activity, second activity, travel to dinner, dinner...(etc...)</div>
        <div class="post-div mt-20">Once you have a rough draft, you can go through and start trying to book your activities to solidify your plan.</div>
